This tool is used to open websites/links by pressing one or more keys on the keyboard, acting as a true shortcut for web pages. When the shortcut keys are pressed, you will be directed to the site previously entered through the main browser set in the system (if the tool does not work after setting the shortcuts, try restarting it).


1) In the "Key Combination:" section, enter the shortcut key(s), for example: f, shift+k, ctrl+u, alt+w, etc.

2) In the "URL:" section, enter the link to the website you want to reach.

3) Then press "Add" to add the link to the window below.

4) The added links can be modified or deleted by pressing the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons, respectively.

5) By pressing "Minimize," the tool's window will be minimized and placed among the hidden icons in the bottom right of Windows (for example, in Windows 10). To reopen it, simply right-click on the tool's icon and click "Show" to bring the tool's screen to the foreground, or click "Exit" to close the tool.
